** self/party buffs and enemy-group debuffs like Warrior's Shouts.

for next dungeon:
** tank doesn't attack normally.	BROKEN, still
 * seems to be related to taunt and dead enemies.
 * seems to affect every class, priest more than others,
** priest sometimes runs away from battle.
 * but mage and rogue have also exhibited the same kind of odd behaviour:
 * starts running when it should be casting.
 * stands still, doesn't do shit.
 * both behaviours can be dispelled by teleport.
 * may be bad "meleeling" state.	PARTIALLY FIXED.
** now seems to affect mostly rogue and tank.

** sap.	TEST

** polymorph doesn't affect some enemies at first.
 * in 3-enemy battles, only after the first is dead does the second get sheeped.

** PersistentAreaAura spells should have cooldown >= duration.
** Fix AreaAura spells.

** use mana pots or Self-Energize spells as needed.
** Inventory GUI: fix updates of items in bags.
** don't try to equip off-hand items if you already have a 2hander.

* Handle SMSG_SPELLORDAMAGE_IMMUNE; don't try casting that spell on that target again.

** In battle, use useful spells on equipment.
 * Ex: Fire Hardened Hauberk, 30+ Rage.

** Trigger quest area-explore objectives.

** For each enchant cast, if a trade window isn't open, ask group member bots if they want it.
 * If they do, open a trade window to one of them and wait for them to put up a suitable item.
 * If the trade window should close, abort cast.
