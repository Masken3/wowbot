Here's a fun programming philosophy problem: should "lua_isnumber()" return "true" for NaN?

Design note: I could, at some points, pass the realTime value to Lua.
I've chosen not to do so to minimize the complexity of the Lua-C interface.

Preliminary decision tree:

If a party member is in combat, attack the tank's target.
* Tanks: if a non-tank is being attacked, taunt the attacker.
* Healers: if a member has lost enough health
  that our most efficient (hp/mana) healing spell will not overheal, use that spell.
** todo: have some provision for extra healing (useful in high-damage situations).
* All: focus attacks on marked targets. This takes priority over the "tank's target" rule.
* Mage: polymorph Moon.
* Rogue: sap Diamond. (only works if target is not in combat.)

If not in combat:
* Quests
** If a quest can be turned in within X yards without aggroing any enemies, do so.
** If leader has picked up a quest, and you don't have it, pick up that quest.
** todo: deal with class and profession quests.

* Gathering
** If a gathering node is nearby and it can be accessed without aggroing, do so.
*** Notify party of nodes guarded by hostiles. Leader may choose to engage the hostiles and thus clear the node.
** Skinning: unless party is in combat with an elite, skin any downed mobs as soon as they are cleared of loot.
** Fishing: normal gathering; get all nodes, or ask for clearing.
*** If fishing water is nearby and party is not moving, go fish.

* Crafting
** When new mats are aquired: check if any new recipes can be crafted. If so, notify party.
** If a quest requires crafted items, craft them only when all mats for all items for that quest are available.
*** Also, require permission from leader before starting craft.
** todo: handle automatic leveling up.
** todo: handle equipment requests from party members.

* Idle movement, only effective if nothing else is being done.
** If leader is >FOLLOW_DIST from us, run to him.
** If leading is walking and within FOLLOW_DIST*2, we too should be walking.
** Attempt to stay FOLLOW_DIST/2 away from every party member, excluding leader.
*** This should cause a decent emergent formation.
